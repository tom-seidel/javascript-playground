# JavaScript Playground

---

This repository serves as a personal playground for experimenting with various JavaScript concepts, features, and small projects. It's a place to learn, test, and practice JavaScript in an isolated environment without affecting larger projects.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore the code or run any of the examples, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tom-seidel/javascript-playground.git
    ```
    
2.  **Navigate into the repository directory:**

    ```bash
    cd javascript-playground
    ```

3.  **Explore the files:**
    Open the directory in your preferred code editor to browse through the different JavaScript files (`.js`) and HTML files (`.html`).

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository is organized by topics or small project ideas. Each folder or file generally focuses on a specific JavaScript concept.

* `./concepts/`: Contains individual JavaScript files demonstrating core language concepts (e.g., closures, prototypes, async/await).
* `./mini-projects/`: Holds small, self-contained projects built with JavaScript (e.g., a simple calculator, a to-do list).
* `./experiments/`: For quick, one-off tests or ideas.
* `index.html`: A potential entry point for examples that require a browser environment.

## ‚ú® How to Use

* **For browser-based examples:** Open the respective `.html` file in your web browser. You can often just drag and drop the file into your browser, or right-click and choose "Open with..."
* **For Node.js examples:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the JavaScript file, and run it using Node.js:

    ```bash
    node path/to/your/file.js
    ```
